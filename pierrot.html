			<h1><br></h1>
			<p class="descriptioncenter pierrotcolor bigdescriptiontext explanationpage">After spending the late 1970s in Europe to escape his drug addiction, Bowie emerged from the other end of the tunnel much healthier as he had succeeded in kicking cocaine out of his life. Under these new conditions, Bowie decided to record a new album, one that drew influences from many of his other critically acclaimed works in the 70s. This new album, <span="italic">Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</span> featured a refreshed Bowie and a new persona, one inspired by miming, an art that Bowie had studied in the 60s. With that, Pierrot was born as a mascot for the new album.</p>

			<h2 class="headingleft pierrotheadercolor">Origins</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft pierrotcolor">In the 60s before he delved into a serious solo music career, Bowie worked as a mime and did shows with a company. While his time as a mime was very temporary, he retained his interest in miming throughout the years. For example, after Bowie met Andy Warhol in 1971, he used miming to pretend to pull out his intestines, a metaphor for how badly the meeting between the two went. In 1980, this interest had obviously resurfaced in the form of Pierrot; named after a term for a common character in miming, used to showcase emotions of sadness and feelings of alienation, hidden under a sheet of silence.</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingleft pierrotheadercolor">Description</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft pierrotcolor">The persona of Pierrot saw Bowie don a flashy sky blue costume and white make-up on his face and his neck. A pointy hat was also sometimes worn by the Pierrot persona. Not much is known about Pierrot's personality, fitting with the fact that pierrots are often silent, introverted figures. In the "Ashes to Ashes" music video, Pierrot spoke about Major Tom's downfall as a sort of narrator and in that sense we can see Pierrot as looming figure, one that watches from the sidelines as other personas live their lives.</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingright pierrotheadercolor">In Music</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright pierrotcolor">Pierrot was used a lot for the marketing of Bowie's album <span="italic">Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</span>, an album that departed from the cold, electronic works that he had made while he was in Europe. This album drew influences from a ton of his previous works like the funk from <span="italic">Young Americans</span> on the track "Fashion" and the synthesizers from his recent Berlin Trilogy on the track "Ashes to Ashes. The album was praised when it was received by critics for its experimental nature. The lead single, "Ashes to Ashes", even hit #1 in the UK Charts, a feat not achieved by Bowie since a re-release of his song "Space Oddity" in 1975. This was part due to a big music video which featured Pierrot which involved a lot of video editing. In fact, at the time the music video for "Ashes to Ashes" was the most expensive of all time due to the expensive editing.</p>

			<h2 class="headingright pierrotheadercolor">Appearances</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright pierrotcolor">Unlike other Bowie personas, Pierrot only existed for a small span of Bowie's career and Pierrot never really interacted with the public like Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke did. Instead, Pierrot was confined to simply the album's artwork and the "Ashes to Ashes" music video. In the "Ashes to Ashes" music video, Pierrot narrates the downfall of one of Bowie's other personas, Major Tom, while the video of him and his surroundings is deepfried in the music video. Meanwhile, Pierrot is heavily depicted in the artwork of the singles and the album. For example, a sketch of Pierrot is proudly displayed on the album's artwork. After the album's run ended, the persona of Pierrot was quietly retired and promptly forgotten to most David Bowie fans.</p>
