			<!-- Briefly explain persona (generally) -->
			<h1><br></h1>
			<p class="descriptioncenter dukecolor bigdescriptiontext explanationpage">In 1976, David Bowie transformed into his darkest character. Fueled by the drug habits he had developed over the past few years, Bowie became the Thin White Duke, a persona inspired by Old European and fascist mythology. This nasty and emotionless character not only drove Bowie to new heights artistically, but also marked the lowest point in Bowie’s life.</p>

			<!-- Create paragraphs to explain the persona's origins-->
			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingleft dukeheadercolor">Origins</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft dukecolor">Fresh off the success of his last R&B and Philly Soul inspired album,<span class="italic">Young Americans</span>, Bowie moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as an actor. This started a dark period in Bowie’s life, as he double downed on his drug intake as he became more connected with Los Angeles’ 70s Drug Culture. For some time, he was on the infamous diet of only milk, cocaine and peppers, greatly thinning his physical appearance.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="descriptionleft dukecolor">Inspirations for the Duke, came from places like the movie <span class="italic">The Man Who Fell to Earth</span>, a movie that Bowie starred in. The character that Bowie played in the movie eventually inspired the look of the Duke. The other inspiration was Bowie’s growing interest in the weird, the occult and the extreme, specifically Bowie’s growing alignment with the ideas of Hitler and his fascist ideology.</p>

			<!-- Create paragraph to describe the persona -->
			<h2 class="headingright dukeheadercolor">Description</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright dukecolor">Appearance wise, the Duke is a slim figure, who wears a simple black vest over a white dress coat and has slicked-back orange hair. The Thin White Duke's personality is conflicting. By looking through the song <span class="italic">Station to Station</span> which features the duke, the Thin White Duke is overwhelmed with the “European Canon”, something that contains him. The duke must stay emotionless and reserved, under a coat of cynicism. However, this is juxtaposed by lyrics in the song that describe a time in the duke’s life when he “could never be down”. And in the latter part of the song, we see how the duke tries to convince himself that the drugs that he takes are not masking the feeling of longing he feels. The longing to be free of his drug-induced state, to be free of his cynicism; a feeling that Bowie at the time could definitely relate to. Once again though, the “European Canon” is preventing him from escaping as he desperately relents that it is too late for him to change.</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingleft dukeheadercolor">In Music</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft dukecolor">The Duke was active during one of Bowie’s albums, <span class="italic">Station to Station</span>, a critically acclaimed album of Bowie’s. The album itself was a transition for Bowie away from his soul inspired music and towards experimental rock, a sound unique to Bowie’s earlier glam rock output. There is a mix of both sounds on the album. His deeper, rougher vocals (probably a product of his addiction) are strong and proudly displayed with roaring, distorted guitars and a variety of strange instruments, like the harpsichord or the vibraslap. Though only six songs make up the album, all of them are quite lengthy. </p>

			<!-- Create a paragraph to explain where the persona has shown up over Bowie's life -->
			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingright dukeheadercolor">Appearances</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright dukecolor">The Duke appeared in interviews Bowie partook in 1976, the artwork for Station to Station era music and on the Isolar tour, the tour that followed the release of the <span="italic">Station to Station</span> album. Bowie’s public image was hurt by the Duke’s appearances, since controversy was raised over the Duke’s statements and actions. Examples include when the Duke performed the nazi salute in front of a crowd of people while making his way to a performance or when the Duke claimed that Hitler was the first true rockstar. Bowie eventually stated years later that this was all performance art and that he didn’t truly believe in fascism, but then again, who would admit to once liking the Nazis. Eventually though, Bowie quietly retired the character after moving to Berlin the next year to try to kick his drug addiciton.</p>
