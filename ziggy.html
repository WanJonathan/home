			<p class="descriptioncenter ziggycolor bigdescriptiontext explanationpage">Alien rockstar messiah. Few things come to mind when those three words are uttered in consecutive order, but to enjoyers of Bowie's music, those three words could only refer to one thing; the greatest persona Bowie had ever created. Ziggy Stardust was an alien that came down to Earth in 1972 to entertain the masses and fuel one of Bowie's greatest albums, <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span>. Ziggy Stardust was not only the standard bearer of Britain's glam rock movement, but also a once in a generation idea that changed popular culture around Britain and the world.</p>

			<h2 class="headingleft ziggyheadercolor">Origins</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft ziggycolor">After his last album <span class="italic">Hunky Dory</span>, a singer-songwiter album that was very piano and lyric oriented, Bowie had an idea. For his next album, Bowie decided to lean into a more dynamic rock sound that involved theatrics to catch the attention of the public, a genre defined as glam rock. Since Bowie already had experience in theatre, he was more than qualified for such a role. And for these theatric, Bowie decided to create a persona to embody for the album. This persona was of course Ziggy Stardust, a character inspired by Kabuki theatre and the alternative rock scene in New York, the scene that helped to inspire Bowie's synopsis for the album.</p>

			<h2><br></h2>
			<h2 class="headingleft ziggyheadercolor">Description</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft ziggycolor">Ziggy Stardust began the trend of Bowie personas having red, flamboyant mullets; a trend that would continue with the introductions of Aladdin Sane and Halloween Jack. While it's easy to associate Ziggy with those other characters, Ziggy can be differentiated by the fact that he has a face painted sun above his nose. In Bowie's album <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span>, a loose narrative is given to grant a deeper meaning to Ziggy Stardust. In the narrative, Ziggy is an alien who comes down to Earth in order to warn humans that their planet will be destroyed in 5 years. While on Earth, Ziggy associates himself with rock n' roll culture by forming the band "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars", a venture that would lead to both him becoming a sort of messiah to the people, but also lead to his death. Pushed by his fans, Ziggy dies in what Bowie called a "Rock and Roll Suicide" (it's the last song off the album and it's where Ziggy dies in the narrative).</p>

			<h2 class="headingright ziggyheadercolor">In Music</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright ziggycolor">Ziggy Stardust oversaw a golden age in Bowie's career since <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span> began a period of immense commercial success and creativity from Bowie's glam rock music. For example, the album <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span> is the most popular Bowie album on Spotify and by a long shot. The album still remains Bowie's second best-selling album, a feat only surpassed by his 1983 megahit <span class="italic">Let's Dance</span>. The songs on <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span> are simpler and had less focus on lyrics compared to his previous works up until that point, but Bowie was still poetic and definitely found his inner rockstar, pumping out hit songs like "Starman", "Moonage Daydream" and "Ziggy Stardust", the last one being a song that narrated the timeline of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars.</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingleft ziggyheadercolor">Appearances</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft ziggycolor">Ziggy made many appearances in interviews, artwork and performances after the album was released. One notable performance of Ziggy's was his appearance on Top of the Pops in 1972, a performance that inspired a multitude of other artists to pursue music. The Ziggy Stardust persona was an essential part of his subsequent tour which lasted until 1973. In this subsequent tour, Bowie's Ziggy persona played music along with a backing band named after Ziggy's fictional backing band from the album <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span>. At a live performance on July 3, 1973, Bowie surprisingly retired the character without warning, leaving his future up to much debate. Eventually though, he would embody new personas, somewhat inspired by Ziggy's look but with different backstories and personalities. </p>
