			<h1><br></h1>
			<p class="descriptioncenter tomcolor bigdescriptiontext explanationpage">In 1969, Bowie revealed to the world his first persona, a spaceman isolated outside of Earth by the name of Major Tom. Major Tom proved Bowie's longest lasting persona, having been referred to many times in songs even after Bowie entered new personas like Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke. Major Tom would appear throughout the years in songs and videos up until the year Bowie died, in 2016.</p>

			<h2 class="headingleft tomheadercolor">Origins</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft tomcolor">With the Apollo 11 launch only a few months away, people in 1969 were excited and curious over the idea of space travel. Bowie's song "Space Oddity" capitalized on the public's interest in space travel and the singer-songwriter style story included an astronaut as its protagonist. This theory proved to be correct since "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first hit song and one of his greatest.</p>

			<img class="displayblock mediumsanding" id="tomashes" src="images/major_tom_ashes.jpg" alt="Major Tom in Ashes to Ashes Video" width="300">
			<h2 class="headingright tomheadercolor">Description</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright tomcolor">In the original "Space Oddity" music video, Major Tom is depicted as a thin astronaut who ventures into space with the help of ground control. He is left alone in space as he loses contact with ground control in the song, isolated from the rest of the world. Truly a cynical ending to the story of space travel. Major Tom was also mentioned in 1980 in the song "Ashes to Ashes" from the album <span class="italic">Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</span>, a song describing his descent into a drug addiction and his fall from greatness. Through these two songs, we see the downfall of Major Tom from a revered astronaut to a disgraced "junkie" as described in "Ashes to Ashes".</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingright tomheadercolor">In Music</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright tomcolor">Major Tom appears in 4 Bowie songs in completely different eras. The first song he appeared in was of course "Space Oddity", a giant hit that was re-released after the immense success of his other albums. The song was originally folk leaning and deep inside singer-songwriter territory when it came to lyrics, however re-recordings had it lean more to rock. The second song he appeared in was "Ashes to Ashes", a deep look into Major Tom's drug addiction and Bowie's own addiction. The song itself was rock oriented with a fresh breath of new wave synthesizers. 1995's "Hallo Spaceboy" and 2015's "Blackstar" also featured Major Tom in the lyrics and music video respectively. "Hallo Spaceboy" came from the hard rocking, industrial sounding <span class="italic">Outside</span> album while "Blackstar" was jazzy, in a song structure akin to Bowie's "Station to Station"</p>

			<h1><br></h1>
			<h2 class="headingleft tomheadercolor">Appearances</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft tomcolor">Major Tom only made four appearances in Bowie's music. In "Space Oddity", he was a slim astronaut lost in space, isolated from the world. Then, in "Ashes to Ashes", we see Major Tom suffer from his own self-destructive nature that turned him into an addict. However, it's important to note that Major Tom the astronaut did not appear in the music video for Ashes to Ashes (although in the music video there is a person in the insane asylum thats sings lines belonging to Major Tom, therefore, that person could also be Major Tom). Instead, Bowie's persona Pierrot tells us the story of Major Tom. In the lyrics to the song "Hallo Spaceboy", we see Major Tom used as a reference to Bowie's mysterious sexual identity and ambiguity early in his career. Meanwhile, in the music video of "Blackstar", Major Tom's helmet is seen on the ground in one of the scenes. This could probably reference the end of Major Tom and his eventual fate.</p>
